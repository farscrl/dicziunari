# Dicziunari Rumantsch

"Dicziunari Rumantsch" is a Romansh dictionary app and combines six different dictionaries with over half a million entries in one app. It was created by [far GmbH](https://www.far.ch) (programming) and [David Bühler - Visuelle Gestaltung](https://www.davidbuehler.ch/) (design).

This project consists of two parts: 
- `db`: These scripts can be used to compile a database from the exports from the dictionaries, which can be used in the app.
- `app`: The code for the actual app

## Data

The language data comes from the official dictionaries, which are also used in the classroom. The dictionaries of the idioms Surmiran and Sutsilvan and Rumantsch Grischun come from pledarigrond.ch, the data in Sursilvan are taken from vocabularisursilvan.ch and the variants in Vallader and Puter are based on the official dictionaries of "Lehrmittel Graubünden".

Currently we are not allowed yet to publish the data here on GitHub. You have to download/request the data yourself from the publishers and build the database used by the app with the scripts in the `db`-folder. Of course you can also get in touch with us via [the apps website](https://www.dicziunari.ch) if you need help getting the data.
